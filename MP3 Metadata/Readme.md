## <a name="use"></a>Use-Case

Bollywood songs usually have multiple artists. The ID3 artist tag of these songs commonly use '&' or ',' to separate artist names. When these songs are scrobbled to last.fm the artists don't show up correctly. So I tried replacing those characters with '/' and it all sort-of worked.
