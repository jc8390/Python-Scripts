		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I have this mundane habit of not starting things from scratch, whenever possible. It is life philosophy. I hardly write my own code, unless I am doing something purely for concept building purposes. I like using already existing fragments and building upon them. I copy chunks of code written by random people. Sometimes, I give them credit, sometimes, I don’t.

It may be a matter of opinion, but I’ve always felt that my time, or for that matter, everybody else’s, is a precious resource. If there is a problem at hand that someone has already solved then why should I waste my time reinventing the wheel.

Now, when I’ve begun to blog (fingers crossed), I’d be applying the same principles to posts I write. I’d shamelessly copy text from any piece of article I find on web. Hopefully I’d cite the source, but please forgive me if I don’t.

And if you’re wondering about the title of the post: It’s a quote by Pablo Picasso.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I’ve never really understood software licenses. What are they? Why are they needed? Who are they trying to protect and from whom? And do they even serve a purpose? Frankly speaking, I don’t even want to know. I sort of hate them.

So, until it becomes a question of survival, everything that I’d ever do would be <a href="http://unlicense.org/">unlicensed</a>. That includes the stuff I code, design or write.

You can copy anything that I claim to be mine and use it however you like. I don’t even demand credit, although it’d be insanely great if you cited me.

P.S.: Sometimes I feel even unlicense is superfluous. Here’s my take at a license –
<blockquote>I did what I had to. It’s your turn bitch! Use your imagination.....</blockquote>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>1 - Getting a feel of minimalism</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Pardon my use of the first person narrative. It was an experiment that probably turned out bad.

It is the sixth of august and I've just realized that I am not convinced with metroMe. I want to go minimalistic now. So the first thing I do is, Google "Minimalism", no better way of starting something you have no idea of. Out of a zillion results, I play it safe by clicking the one from Wikipedia. I just skim over the article.

Back to Google, I type "Minimalist design websites", press enter and am again greeted by a multitude of results, I skip over the top three to find "20 Inspiring Minimalist Web Designs". That’s just what I need. Ctrl+Click on the link, Ctrl+Tab. Whistle while the article loads.

The article has links to 20 different websites with their screenshots, so you can decide for yourself. After checking out a few links and being convinced that I am not looking for anything like them, I find two could-come-in-handy sites, and as always, I bookmark them.

Scrolling down the same article, I find link to a seemingly similar article “19 Examples of Minimalistic Web Designs”, Couldn’t have asked for more. Without thinking for a second, I open it. And after going through some more links, I find <a href="http://manuelmoreale.com/">this</a> gem and It almost kills me. I know this is exactly what I want, Just know it.

Fifteen minutes in and I already have a homepage, not bad. Problem one solved. Which brings me to problem two: Where am I gonna put links to other sections of the site? The footer just seems unintuitive and I don’t want the traditional navigation bar design. This really is a problem and I am out of ideas. What’d I do?

Google. This time with a slight change of keywords “Minimalist web design”. I open an article called “Showcase of Super Clean Minimalist Web Designs”. The first <a href="http://yaronschoen.com/">link</a> in the article solves the problem and I suddenly get a few ideas, I perfectly visualize them and am convinced that this is going somewhere.

That’s when I begin writing this article. And it takes me about an hour to write up till this very point. Writing is hard.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Why metroMe sucks?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I’ve decided to abandon metroMe and am now working on yet another website design codenamed miniMe. I’ve also decided to blog the entire process of development. So this article is the first of many that I’d be posting (fingers crossed) in the coming days.

If you don’t know what metroMe is, it’s because I never made it public. It was a website I had developed using a heck load of external dependencies. Now when I am starting afresh, I think it’d be better to tell you – what went wrong.

Firstly, I didn’t have a set plan when I started it. I was overly obsessed with “Metro UI” and just happened to find metroui.css project. So I thought why not create a metro based website just for the fun of it and the project started with no ‘needs’ whatsoever, purely driven by coding ecstasy.

Take a look at the metroMe codebase and there’ll be just one word on your mind: Shit, because that’s what it is. The entire site is based on the metroui.css framework which in itself is a 6000+ lined css files. So every time I had to change something, I’d just add new code rather than modifying the original (which would’ve been a mind boggling task.) As a result the website is filled with hacks and fixes which hold it together, imagine wearing a tuxedo that’s held together by safety pins.

Another major bug: The website works perfectly only on Google Chrome, because that’s the browser I use. It works partially on Firefox and hasn't been tested on other browsers. I couldn’t figure out the real source of the problem but it might be another side-effect of metroui.css

Once you have designed a website, the fact that hits you is – You need content to keep going. And while coding/designing might be fun, gathering something to post is a different story altogether. Once I decided to add some articles, I also had to design an interface to present them beautifully and although I worked hard but wasn’t convinced with the end result. Maybe I didn’t exactly understand “Metro” as a design language. I wouldn’t blame myself though, Design Theory is a whole course in itself.

I'd hopefully be fixing these problems and a whole lot more in miniMe.

I’ve attached some screenshots of metroMe for those who want to have a look. The source code is all fugged up and I’d need time to make it worth uploading (which I don’t intend to) but in case you need it, you can contact me and I’ll see how I can help.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Design Guidelines</h1>
<h2>Responsive from the start</h2>
You probably have seen responsive web in action but might not be aware of its presence.
<blockquote>Responsive web design (RWD) is a web design approach aimed at crafting sites to provide an optimal viewing experience—easy reading and navigation with a minimum of resizing, panning, and scrolling—across a wide range of devices (from desktop computer monitors to mobile phones).  - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design">Wikipedia</a></blockquote>
I’ll try to ensure that miniMe looks just as beautiful on a mobile device as on a large screen.

Another aspect that I think could come under responsiveness is Browser independence. What good is a website that works only on one browser.
<h2>Copy Less, Code More</h2>
I have a habit of copying code from multiple sources and putting it all together to make things work. I now intend to change it, not that I don’t find it useful anymore but I just plan to actually code most of the stuff by myself – something I hardly do.
<h2>Minimalism Everywhere</h2>
If you still haven’t figured out - miniMe stands for Minimalist Me. So minimalism is going to play a central role. It’d be everywhere, starting right from the design – the looks – to the back end – the code.

I plan to use minimum number of external dependencies, plugins and templates. This is going to be hard.
<h2>Unison with Wordpress</h2>
I’ve come to realise that when it comes to CMS – Wordpress just rocks. So I plan to link miniMe with wordpress perfectly. I still haven’t figured out the entire model but this has to be done.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Readability: Read without distractions</title>
		<link>http://dufferzafar.engineerinme.com/blog/readability-read-without-distractions/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I read a lot, a heck lot actually. Be it quora, wikipedia or some random article on a blog. But the problem with reading on the web is the distraction that comes with it. You are constantly bugged by some image on a sidebar or that annoying ad on the top of the article. But worry no more, because<span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.714285714;"> I've just found a great way of reading web articles, by stripping them down just to the core: the central text.</span>

Enter Readability.

<a href="http://readability.com/">Readability</a> is a simple add-on for browsers designed to create a distraction free reading mode. It's a very simple, yet exceptionally useful. All you need to do is, head over to their website, sign up for an account, and add a plugin to your browser. Once it is added, just surf the net like you usually do and click the button whenever you find a web page that you want formatted in a clean, readable fashion. And then, read away.

Readability is very customizable, offering the ability to change the font type and size as well as the column width of the text within the page. You can also change the background color to simulate a night mode, perfect for late night reading.

It also maintains a reading list, categorizing articles that you haven't read, and archiving the ones you have. You can also tag articles which adds another realm to categorizing, you can then sort articles by your tags.

Sadly, but not surprisingly, there's no windows phone app. So, I can't catch up to my reading on a my phone but Android and iOS users, as always, can. I hate you guys.

Update:

I must've been feeling pretty sleepy when I first wrote this because just a little googling resulted in a few unofficial readability clients for Windows Phone. I tested atleast three of them, and none has everything that you'd expect from a readability app but one of them stands out as it comes with offline cache support, so you can read even when you are disconnected, that's exactly what I need.

You can download <a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/now-readable/0a8cdd51-4a70-4172-b8fb-a274865cccc6">Now Readable</a> and wish that the developer adds some more features like font size, background color, and most importantly - landscape mode support.

Update 2:

Turns out, Now Readable's sync feature has a few bugs due to which I was not able to sync my reading list. I was not going to sit quiet about it, So I contacted its developer <a href="https://twitter.com/chustar">@chustar</a> and he hopes to fix the bug and release an update. Yay!]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Bookviser: Enjoying a good book on windows phone</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Quite evidently, there's a lack of good apps for windows phone. I could do away with a lesser number of social networking options available but a decent ebook reader, come on, I just can't live without one.

Thankfully, there's Bookviser, having a sleek modern UI that just feels right.

It supports EPUB, FB2 and TXT formats, and If you are thinking I probably missed PDF by mistake, then let me welcome you to the world of Windows Phone. Here, you get less apps with even lesser features. But, t'is what it is.

When you open a book, you get clear instructions on how to flip across a book, where you need to tap etc. You can change font size, color, brightness without quitting the book. There's also a bookmark feature which creates  a cute little bookmark icon hanging on top to let you know that it’s a bookmarked page.

<strong>Last Opened Books</strong> displays a tile view of the books you recently read with their cover pages to help you recognize them easily. Right from here you will be able to manage them i.e. Pin to Start Menu, Delete or Open the book. Nice and Simple.

You can add new books by searching online catalogs, which include sites like Project Gutenberg and FeedBooks, or by directly downloading from the inbuilt web browser. None of these methods suit my needs. And this is where things get a bit frustrating...

I rely on skydrive to sync my books because it offers the flexibility to add books that I've downloaded from torrents (long live the pirates) or converted from a PDF. I upload the ePub file to skydrive and then sync it with the app. So basically, to add a book (from torrent) you first have to download it on your computer, then upload it to skydrive and then again download it on your device. Three times bandwidth usage. Sob.

I am wishing for an update that'd add features like - Adding a book from SD Card, PDF Support etc. Till then, can't do anything but read another book.

		<title>Source Code Editors: Sublime text and Notepad++</title>
		<link>http://dufferzafar.engineerinme.com/blog/source-code-editors-sublime-text-and-notepad/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<b></b>For a coder, the choice of a text editor is almost a political statement. Everybody has, and should have, their own personal preferences. Part of the appeal of the editor comes from its leanness and simplicity. Here are two of the best code editors, although I'd highly recommend sublime text, I just can't seem to let go of Notepad++. Old habits die hard, as they say.
<h1><strong>Sublime Text</strong></h1>
<a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/3">Sublime Text</a> certainly feels lean on the surface, with no toolbars or configuration dialogs. It's also very, very fast. But that simplicity is only skin-deep: dig in just a bit, and you'll find yourself immersed in plugins, keyboard shortcuts, and more.

<strong>Looks</strong>: The most noticeable feature, and probably the only thing you'll notice at first glance, is the mini-map which runs along the right-side gutter of the editing pane. It can be used as a <span style="font-size: 1rem;">visual scrollbar w</span><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">hen working on long files. The other thing that catches attention is the night-mode styled theme which is easy on the eyes, if you want daylight mode or want to experiment with some other colors, goto Preferences - Color Schemes, and select something that suits you.</span>

There's also a Distraction Free Mode, which hides away all the crap and takes you into a fullscreen mode where you can just code and code and code.

<strong>Commands: </strong>The single most important feature that you'll be using is the command palette. Press Ctrl+Shift+P and you can control every single function, plugin, menu item, and what not by just typing in the some text. Seriously Cool.

<strong>Extensibilty</strong>: Sublime Text has some great plugins, the most important of which is called <a href="https://sublime.wbond.net/installation">Package Control</a>, it lets you easily search, download and install other plugins right from the editor. It took me around five seconds to add autohotkey syntax highlight support, and that too, without ever leaving the editor.

These are some of the most basic features, I'll be adding the rest as and when I find them.
<h1>Notepad++</h1>
The only reason I am adding <a href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org/download">NPP</a> here is because no matter how much I resist the temptation, I find myself opening it every now and then. I've been using it for some two years now and am just addicted to the view it presents. I'm used to the default syntax highlighting - Green represents comments, Blue is for functions etc.

Probably the only plus point with notepad++ is that its free and open source. But that matters only if you have a high conscience or, for some other reason, have vowed not to use pirated software. In which case, I'll salute you and ridicule you at the same time.

I am not saying that Notepad++ is in any way less equipped than sublime text. It's been there since 2003 (that's a f'king decade) and is still going strong, Don Ho updates it frequently and it has more features than you'll probably ever need.

But when you are trying something new, you might as well try something that's more sexy. And Sublime Text is sexy as hell.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I've made a few tweaks to sublime text, you know, to make life that bit easier.
<ul>
	<li>Disabled Update Check. Duh!</li>
	<li>Remove trailing spaces from your file using a setting.</li>
	<li>Installed Package Control, Autohotkey, INI Syntax Packages</li>
	<li>Added "Open With Sublime" to windows context menu. A REG File - Modifies settings in the registry but comes in handy. You can open any file, folder right from the explorer.</li>
	<li>Ctrl+Shift+S - Runs any open file. Super Useful. Comes from an autohotkey script I wrote - Windows Helper. I'd share it once I clean up the code a bit.</li>
	<li>SideBarEnhancements - Does what it says.</li>
</ul>
I also did a setup of C++, finally. Turbo was beginning to get on my nerves. I installed <a href="nuwen.net/mingw.html">MinGW</a>, doing which was straightforward - you just need to extract the archive, well, that and the path variable modification. But it was worth it, I can now build/run C files right from sublime text.

<a href="https://github.com/sergeche/emmet-sublime">Emmet</a> was the next plugin I installed, It is basically an abbreviation engine which allows you to expand expressions. Superb for high-speed HTML, or any other structured code format, coding and editing.

<a href="https://github.com/condemil/Gist">Gist</a> is another plugin that comes in handy. You just have to type "Create Gist" in the command palette, the plugin does the rest and copies the url of the gist to clipboard, ready for sharing.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>miniMe Paused - Cryptex Resumed</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[And it happened yet again - I switched projects - something I often do.

This time it's Cryptex - a game we'd thought of back in january but never actually got into building it.

Let me get into the details, Cryptex was originally a hacking challenge created by two of our seniors. Hammad bhai designed the online rounds while Vipul did the offline ones. I also created a level, although I was not really sure how it'd be used until I actually saw it in action.

I participated too, stood second, but the best thing that happened was - I thought of some really cool improvements that could be made. I knew that many features could be added which'll make the game much more fun. I shared the idea with Shivam and he too was excited, we decided that we'd do the entire thing during the summer break, we even created a Trello board to gather ideas and all but..... procrastination got the best of us and nothing was ever done.

The project was shelved, until recently, when Shivam said he really wanted to do it.

Cryptex is going to be a complete Web Dev thing with loads of back-end stuff, and I too am interested in doing some PHP/MySQL shit, so I've decided to put miniMe on hold - it's a personal project and i can return back anytime I want.

As of now, I'll be developing Cryptex 2 along with Shivam and anybody else who is interested. I've never coded along with someone, so it'll be fun. Let's just hope for the best.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Hacking WTF!</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This page won't teach you how to hack, so if you were here for that sorry but you'll just end up wasting your time.

Hacking is often portrayed to be many things it is not. Thanks to the media's portrayal of hackers as immoral computer experts who are associated with all sorts of illegal computer activities, we find that hackers are portrayed as cyber outlaws out to steal your passwords or break into your bank account to steal your money.

Today this flawed portrayal might not be farther from truth, but this is not how hacking actually started. I can't tell you the entire story here and won't give you the gist of it because I don't think history should be summed up. If you really are interested in knowing about some of the greatest minds in computer history, I'd suggest reading *this* cult classic by Steven Levy. I've read some parts of it but am yet to complete.

Generally speaking - hacking has nothing to do with computers. It applies to the whole wide world around you. You could hack your cupboard to make more room for your stuff, hack your body to fight jet lag, reset your bio clock or alter your sleep cycles. The list is endless and thankfully there happens to be a pretty awesome website dedicated to life hacking.

Hacking, I believe, is a way of thinking. It's about being curious, asking loads of questions and not being afraid of experimenting with things. Hackers are motivated by a desire to understand - how things work, why they work and what would happen if you'd change something.

So if hackers are just random curious guys wanting to know stuff, who are all those people doing computer shit in the movies? They are criminals. Period.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[After leaving Steve Jobs' biography in the middle, I decided to read Wozniak's account and thankfully completed it. The book turned out to be a great read, even though the language was a bit sloppy but it was all overshadowed by Woz's passion for computers and electronics.

Some of the passages from the book are really inspiring, I've read them over and over again, and just can't get enough. I am sharing them here for anybody who's interested, though it'd be far better if you read the book.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Writing code is one thing, but sharing with the world is a different story altogether.

I have chunks of code scattered all over my hard drive. Some of it is pretty naive while the others are really cool. Some solve a particular problem while some are just proof-of-concepts. They are all worth sharing nonetheless.

I have a few repositories on github where most of my code is hosted. The only thing that stops me from pushing all my code to github is the fear that It'll end up half-assed. And I don't want to do that.

The scripts that I write mostly contain dirty hacking - code that just works. They are written with just one thing in mind after all and that is to get the shit done. Now, I don't want anybody to read my dirty code, that'd be crap right?

So before pushing anything onto github I try to ensure that my code meets some standards. It should be readable even by a newbie, extensible so that people can add their own fragments. I add comments to make sure the reader gets what's exactly happening.

This process, the one wherein I ensure code quality is time consuming and a bit boring if you ask me, but it's necessary and just can't be ignored.

Most of my Github repositories are in a pretty abject state. It's been in the last month that I've started paying them the attention that they deserve.

I created <a href="https://github.com/dufferzafar/win-butler">Win-Butler</a> last week by merging some of my existing scripts. Most of the code was already written and all I had to do was assemble the chunks, remove crap and add comments. It took me about three hours to do so but I am fairly happy with the output. The script is clean and can be easily edited. Also, it felt great to churn out some AHK after a long time.

I've polished <a href="https://github.com/dufferzafar/Autohotkey-Scripts">Autohotkey-Scripts</a> - redundant scripts have been removed, new ones added. I've also added readmes to some the of scripts. There's still a lot of work to be done - I need to further cleanup most of the code, add remaining readmes. I also have some viruses/pranks scripts written that I need to refine and push.

<a href="https://github.com/dufferzafar/AMS-Projects">AMS-Projects</a> has been updated with the readme. I don't plan to further improve anything.

<a href="https://github.com/dufferzafar/libLua">libLua </a>is a real mess. There's no documentation on what functions are available, the code files themselves are scattered and need to be standardized. I think I should separate bigNum into a separate repository as it really is worthy of some attention.

<a href="https://github.com/dufferzafar/Project-Euler-Soultions">Project-Euler-Solutions</a> - The only reason I uploaded these solutions was because they were solved in pure Lua. I coded from scratch any dependency that I needed (bigNum is an example.) This repo is a mess too. I can scrub most of the solutions and could probably increase the efficiency of some.

<a href="https://github.com/dufferzafar/shar">Shar </a>- This algorithm is so naive that I wouldn't even have uploaded the code had it been in any other language. But you can't just throw away code written in Lua. As of now the cipher is amateurish and there isn't much hope for it but still I think I'll rewrite the code someday, write a readme too. Till then...]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I messed up really big time the day before yesterday. I was working on Cryptex - a hacking challenge sort-of thing. I don't exactly remember what I was doing, maybe renaming some files... when I saw a folder that shouldn't have been there, so I did what I always do - press Shift+Delete followed by Enter.

A moment later I started yelling - fuck! fuck! shit! - I said some not-so-decent things in Hindi too but let's not get into that detail. Turns out, I deleted the entire Cryptex root folder. Everything related to the project Gone.

Thankfully the code was also stored on Github but I had not pushed my most recent local changes - the ones I was working on. Hard Luck.

The first thing that came to my mind as I sat down for damage control was the fact that files are never actually deleted (If you think I'm crazy, read <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/125521/htg-explains-why-deleted-files-can-be-recovered-and-how-you-can-prevent-it/">this</a>.) It's all there on the hard drive, so I could just bring it all back (in theory.) I started Recuva - a free tool to recover deleted data. It took about a minute to find tonnes of deleted shit on my "C:" drive but sadly, and not surprisingly, the files I needed weren't listed. Welcome to the real world.

Recuva also provides an option to Deep scan your drives but I've used that stuff before -- It'd have taken about an hour to find the files and the chances of recovery would still have been feeble.

So, having nothing left to try, I synced the folder with Github but it was about a day old and everything I had done in the past twenty hours was gone. Shit Happens. It's like clearing some checkpoints and then forgetting to save the game. Now you'll have to replay the levels and so I did...

I did everything all over again -- wrote the code, renamed the files, some more shit. It turned out to be fairly okay if you ask me.

But now, as I am writing this, I'm really glad that it all happened because -

A. I got to write this blog post, I love writing and all I need is a topic I sincerely care about.

B. I thought of a nifty bug in the code I was writing -- had something to do with disabled javascript in the user's browser.

C. Most importantly, I learnt the importance of backups and why they are as essential as everybody claims them to be. So I decided that I'd backup my stuff too. But come on, you don't expect me to copy folders to some other place every time I update something. Nope, I am gonna write a script to do that.

I have figured out all the internals. I'll code it in AHK (duh!) and it'll be timer based -- backups will be made every fifteen minutes or so. I am going to use 7zip to compress the folder and copy it to some place that I don't normally visit (what if I end up deleting the backups too? *shudder*)

The script will maintain at least 5 different snapshots and would delete the older one as soon as the new one comes in. I'll start by adding the core functionality first to get stuff working and would then work on additional features. It sounds fairly simple on paper. Let's see how it turns out...
