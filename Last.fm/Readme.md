## <a name="usage"></a>Top Tracks Playlist

Get top tracks of an artist and then locate them on the filesystem.

Usage Scenario:

I mostly download the entire discography of artists and then can't decide which song I should listen to first.

This script downloads the list of top tracks (say 20) of an artist from last.fm. It then searches for those mp3 files on your hard drive and creates a m3u playlist with tracks found.

So I have the best tracks of an artist and can then listen to only those.

## <a name="usage"></a>Scrobbles Today

Last.fm has nice statistics options. So you can view how many songs you've listened to in say a week or a month etc.

But surprisingly you can't view the number of songs you have listened to today.

This script solves that.
